# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that leads to inaccurate results.  The issue is related to incorrect usage of the `$match` and `$group` stages, causing unexpected counts.  The solution provides a corrected pipeline with explanations.

## Bug Description
The provided aggregation pipeline aims to count occurrences of a specific field within a collection and then return the top 10 most frequent entries. However, due to a flaw in the pipeline's construction (possibly incorrect field selection or filter conditions), the resulting counts are incorrect.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates a revised aggregation pipeline that accurately counts the occurrences of the target field. The correction involves carefully reviewing and refining the `$match` and `$group` stages to ensure they accurately reflect the desired filtering and aggregation logic. This is done by double checking the field path selection and any applied filters to eliminate any potential sources of errors.
